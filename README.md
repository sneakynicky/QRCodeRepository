## My process
I looked at the provided images and started to draw it out on a piece of paper to list down the components needed. Once I had an idea, I decided to use Flexbox only because it seemed to be only a one-dimensional process. 

Next, I started by creating the components in the HTML file like how I imagined it would be nested. From there, I took it from the outside-in approach from the container to the card, to the image, to the header and content. 

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. I actually don't know how to start and address the CSS challenge. I think that I know what I'm doing but it seems to be a lot of just trial and error. Mostly, I just don't how how to tackle the styling problem and address it methodically. 
2. Spacing and positioning still eludes me. Even though I'm using Flexbox (because I need to learn it), I don't quite understand what I'm doing and solely relying on my older ways to figure out how to get things done. 
3. I learnt to use the @import statement. That's new to me. 


### Continued development

I want to be able to create layouts and components using Flexbox first. Understanding how it works along with what other content I need to know like box sizing, padding, margins, spacing. When do I use rem? When do I use em? I need to figure this out.
